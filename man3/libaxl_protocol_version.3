.TH libaxl_protocol_version 3 libaxl
.SH NAME
libaxl_protocol_version - X protocol version
.B (ADVANCED)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libaxl.h>

extern const int libaxl_protocol_version;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B libaxl_protocol_version
variable is set to the number, as the sum of the
major number multiplied by 1000 and the minor
number, of the highest version of the X protocol
that the library, as linked against, supports.
For example if the version number is 11.0, 11000
is returned, and if it is 11.2, 11002 is assigned
to the variable.
.SH NOTES
There is no corresponding variable for the
lowest supported version. The lowest supported
version is 11.0 (X11); X11 was released in
September 1987 and predates Linux, thus
this is extremely unlikely this will change.
