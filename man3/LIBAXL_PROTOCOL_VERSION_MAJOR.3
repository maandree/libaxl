.TH LIBAXL_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR 3 libaxl
.SH NAME
LIBAXL_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR - X protocol version, major number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <libaxl.h>

#define LIBAXL_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR /* value omitted */
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR LIBAXL_PROTOCOL_VERSION_MAJOR
macro expands to the major number of the
highest version of the X protocol that
the library, as compiled against, supports.
.SH NOTES
There is no corresponding macro for the lowest
supported version. The lowest supported
version is 11.0 (X11); X11 was released in
September 1987 and predates Linux, thus
this is extremely unlikely this will change.
